# ecc-binary-field
A very na√Øve implementation of elliptic curve operations in the binary field GF(2^n).

These were Python codes I created for my bachelor's thesis project, which was about an attempt to perform ElGamal encryption using elliptic curves over GF(2^n).
This implementation is more of a proof of concept than a secure implementation. Feel free to play around with the curve-new.py, but you should NOT use this code to provide encryption should you need one.
